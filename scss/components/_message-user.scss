// Message User Widget
// Create a field for searching for a user.
// You don't have to add real search functionality, but if you attempt to get the exceeds grade, you'll need to make up some user data.
// Add a message textarea field that lets you add a message.
// Create a “Send” button and use JS to allow you to submit the form and display a confirmation the message was sent. You won't actually submit the form, just simulate the action using JavaScript.
// Use JS to display error messages if user isn’t selected or message field is empty.
// Style to match the overall look and feel of the dashboard.

// Add an "autocomplete" feature for the "Search for User" box, listing names that match the search term.
